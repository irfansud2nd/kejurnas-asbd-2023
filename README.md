# Kejuaraan Nasional ASBD 2023 - Registration Website

## Introduction

Kejuaaran Nasional ASBD is an annual event orginized by [Al-Azhar Seni Bela Diri](https://silatalazhar.com/) and supported by event organizer owned by my close friend. Therefore, I have the opportunity to facilitate registrations through the website that I have developed.

180 Users\
5 Admins

Accommodating 1776 data consisting of:

- 101 Kontingens
- 1511 Athletes
- 164 Officials

This website is also my second paid and commercial project. I know this website is far from perfect. It was created in just one week, but I still maintain this website until the event is over. Nevertheless, I cannot make many improvements because I also maintain [another website](https://github.com/irfansud2nd/portue-championship) that has similar functions to this one at the same time.

## Features

## Discalaimer

- Admin pages are usually accessible only to admins, but for the sake of my personal portfolio, I have changed the access to anyone with their Google account.
- Current database is different from the database used for Kejuaaran Nasional ASBD. this is done to avoid mixed data and free acces to admin page.
